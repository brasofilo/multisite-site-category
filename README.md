# Multisite Site Category ![MTT logo](https://raw.github.com/brasofilo/Private-Comments-in-CPT/master/logo.png)


WordPress plugin for managing sites categories.

## Description
The plugin adds a new field "category" to the Site Info screen. 
A sortable column is also added in the Sites list screen.
A Categories submenu is created under Sites, add or remove categories there.

The column `mature` in the table `wp_blogs` is being used as index to the categories.  
This is a workaround to allow sorting the sites based on categories.  
There's a filter being applied (except in the sites screen) that tells WordPress that the site is **not mature**:
```
if( 'sites.php' != $pagenow )
    add_filter( 'site_details', array( $this, 'hack_mature_queries' ) );	
public function hack_mature_queries( $details )
{
    $details->mature = 0;
    return $details;
}
```
Sooo... this workaround assumes the Multisite doesn't contain mature material ;)

Right now, there's no category selection when creating or signing up for new sites.  
The code from the old plugin is [still present](https://github.com/brasofilo/multisite-site-category/blob/master/inc/class-sites-categories-signup.php), but inactive.  
To be able to sort the sites, the logic changed a lot and I haven't revised the new site features.

Available hooks:
```
// Cache time, default 3600 (1hour)
add_filter( 'msc_transient_time', function(){ return 1; } );
// For debugging purposes
add_filter( 'msc_show_mature_column', '__return_true' );
```
